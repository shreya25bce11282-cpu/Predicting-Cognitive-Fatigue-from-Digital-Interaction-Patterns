# Feature Rationale

This document explains how each selected feature maps to established cognitive processes. Feature selection was guided by cognitive load theory, attention research, and working memory limitations rather than purely statistical considerations.

## Session Duration

**Cognitive Basis:** Sustained attention  
Longer sessions require prolonged attentional engagement. Without recovery, attentional resources degrade, increasing fatigue.

---

## Scroll Events

**Cognitive Basis:** Perceptual and attentional demand  
Frequent scrolling forces continuous perceptual re-parsing of new content, increasing cognitive effort even when content is shallow.

---

## Interaction Density

**Cognitive Basis:** Working memory load  
High interaction density reflects rapid cognitive demands per unit time, increasing the likelihood of working memory overload.

---

## Late-Night Usage

**Cognitive Basis:** Reduced executive control  
Late night usage coincides with circadian dips in cognitive control, reducing the brain’s ability to regulate attention and resist fatigue.

---

## Notifications

**Cognitive Basis:** Extraneous cognitive load  
Notifications introduce task irrelevant stimuli, fragment attention, and increase switching costs.

---

## Task Switches

**Cognitive Basis:** Attentional switching cost  
Each task switch incurs a cognitive cost due to reorientation and context rebuilding, accelerating fatigue accumulation.

## Target Variable: Fatigue Score

Fatigue score represents a proxy measure of cognitive exhaustion resulting from sustained interaction. While simplified, it captures cumulative cognitive strain arising from attentional and working memory demands.
